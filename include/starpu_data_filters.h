	   The details of what needs to be filled in \p child_interface vary according

	   <ul>
	   <li> <c>id</c> is usually just copied over from the father,

	   e.g. a subvector is a vector, a submatrix is a matrix, etc.
	   This is however not the case for instance when dividing a
	   BCSR matrix into its dense blocks, which then are matrices.
	   </li>
	   <li> <c>nx</c>, <c>ny</c> and alike are usually divided by
	   the number of subdata, depending how the subdivision is
	   done (e.g. nx division vs ny division for vertical matrix
	   division vs horizontal matrix division). </li>
	   <li> <c>ld</c> for matrix interfaces are usually just
	   copied over: the leading dimension (ld) usually does not
	   change. </li>
	   <li> <c>elemsize</c> is usually just copied over. </li>
	   <li> <c>ptr</c>, the pointer to the data, has to be
	   computed according to \p i and the father's <c>ptr</c>, so
	   as to point to the start of the sub data. This should
	   however be done only if the father has <c>ptr</c> different
	   from NULL: in the OpenCL case notably, the
	   <c>dev_handle</c> and <c>offset</c> fields are used
	   instead. </li>
	   <li> <c>dev_handle</c> should be just copied over from the
	   parent. </li>
	   <li> <c>offset</c> has to be computed according to \p i and

	   the start of the sub data. This is notably used for the
