 * Codelets have a "name" attribute that is really useful for debugging
 * purposes. Lots of codelets do not use this attribute though, mostly because
 * they were written when it was not available.
 *
 * This semantic patch tries to add a "name" attribute when it is necessary.
 * The chosen name is the name of the codelet variable : it should be good
 * enough for debugging.
