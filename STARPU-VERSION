# Versioning (SONAMEs) for StarPU libraries.

# http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html#Updating-version-info
# Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:
# Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool library.
# Update the version information only immediately before a public
# release of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and
# only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.
# - If the library source code has changed at all since the last
#   update, then increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).
# - If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
#   last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
# - If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
#   then increment age.
# - If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last
#   public release, then set age to 0. change

# This is the tarball version, major.minor

# Note for StarPU 1.1: we have changed ABI
# Note for StarPU 1.2: reset everything to 0:0:0
