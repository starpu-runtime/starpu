/*
 * This example demonstrates how to use StarPU to scale an array by a factor.
 * It shows how to manipulate data with StarPU's data management library.
 *  1- how to declare a piece of data to StarPU (starpu_vector_data_register)
 *  2- how to describe which data are accessed by a task (task->handles[0])
 *  3- how a kernel can manipulate the data (buffers[0].vector.ptr)
 *
 * This is a variant of vector_scal.c which shows it can be integrated with fortran.
