This is a sample 3D stencil application (here just using the game of life rules
for simplicity), split on the z axis.

This is a suggest order of read:

life.c
life.cu: Heart of the stencil computation: compute a new state from an old one.

shadow.cu
shadow.h: Perform replication of data on X and Y edges, to fold the domain on
itself through mere replication of the source state.

stencil.h: Declarations

stencil-kernels.c: Computation Kernels

stencil-blocks.c: Manage block and tags allocation

stencil-tasks.c: Schedule tasks for updates and saves

stencil.c: Main application

*.out: various results according to beta value (communication vs computation
penalty ratio), run make pics or make view to get pictures.
mpi.out: results on MPI.

results: a few results

You can also use the implicit distributed flavour of this application (e.g.
with communications between processes automatically inferred by StarPU-MPI),
which is called implicit_stencil.
