Installing Julia
----------------
Julia version 1.3+ is required and can be downloaded from
https://julialang.org/downloads/.


Installing StarPU module for Julia
----------------------------------
First, build the jlstarpu_c_wrapper library:

$ make

Then, you need to add the lib/ directory to your library path and the julia/
directory to your Julia load path:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/src/.lib
$ export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=$PWD/src:$JULIA_LOAD_PATH

This step can also be done by sourcing the setenv.sh script:

$ . setenv.sh

Running Examples
----------------

You can find several examples in the examples/ directory.

For each example X, three versions are provided:

- X.c: Original C+starpu code
- X_native.jl: Native Julia version (without StarPU)
- X.jl: Julia version using StarPU


To run the original C+StarPU code:
$ make cstarpu.dat

To run the native Julia version:
$ make julia_native.dat

To run the Julia version using StarPU:
$ make julia_generatedc.dat
