\subsection CoreEntitiesOverview Overview

Execution entities:
- <b>worker</b>: A worker (see \ref CoreEntitiesWorkers, \ref
  CoreEntitiesWorkersAndContexts) entity is a CPU thread created by StarPU to manage
  one computing unit. The computing unit can be a local CPU core, an accelerator
  or GPU device, or --- on the master side when running in master-slave
  distributed mode --- a remote slave computing node. It is responsible for
  querying scheduling policies for tasks to execute.

- <b>sched_context</b>: A scheduling context (see \ref CoreEntitiesContexts, \ref
  CoreEntitiesWorkersAndContexts) is a logical set of workers governed by an
  instance of a scheduling policy. It defines the computing units to which the
  scheduling policy instance may assign work entities.

- <b>driver</b>: A driver is the set of hardware-dependent routines used by a
  worker to initialize its associated computing unit, execute work entities on
  it, and finalize the computing unit usage at the end of the session.

Work entities:
- <b>task</b>: A task is a high level work request submitted to StarPU by the
  application, or internally by StarPU itself.

- <b>job</b>: A job is a low level view of a work request. It is not exposed to
  the application. A job structure may be shared among several task structures
  in the case of a parallel task.

Data entities:
- <b>data handle</b>: A data handle is a high-level, application opaque object designating a
  piece of data currently registered to the StarPU data management layer.
  Internally, it is a \ref _starpu_data_state structure.

- <b>data replicate</b>: A data replicate is a low-level object designating one
  copy of a piece of data registered to StarPU as a data handle, residing in one
  memory node managed by StarPU. It is not exposed to the application.

\subsection CoreEntitiesWorkers Workers

A <b>worker</b> is a CPU thread created by StarPU. Its role is to manage one computing
unit. This computing unit can be a local CPU core, in which case, the worker
thread manages the actual CPU core to which it is assigned; or it can be a
computing device such as a GPU or an accelerator (or even a remote computing
node when StarPU is running in distributed master-slave mode.) When a worker
manages a computing device, the CPU core to which the worker's thread is
by default exclusively assigned to the device management work and does not
participate to computation.

\subsubsection CoreEntitiesWorkersStates States

<b>Scheduling operations related state</b>

While a worker is conducting a scheduling operations, e.g. the worker is in the
process of selecting a new task to execute, flag state_sched_op_pending is set
to \c !0, otherwise it is set to \c 0.

While state_sched_op_pending is !0, the following exhaustive list of operations on that
workers are restricted in the stated way:

- adding the worker to a context is not allowed;
- removing the worker from a context is not allowed;
- adding the worker to a parallel task team is not allowed;
- removing the worker from a parallel task team is not allowed;
- querying state information about the worker is only allowed while
  <code>state_relax_refcnt > 0</code>;
  - in particular, querying whether the worker is blocked on a parallel team entry is only
  allowed while <code>state_relax_refcnt > 0</code>.

Entering and leaving the state_sched_op_pending state is done through calls to
\ref _starpu_worker_enter_sched_op() and \ref _starpu_worker_leave_sched_op()
respectively (see these functions in use in functions \ref _starpu_get_worker_task() and
\ref _starpu_get_multi_worker_task()). These calls ensure that any pending
conflicting operation deferred while the worker was in the
state_sched_op_pending state is performed in an orderly manner.

<br>
<b>Scheduling contexts related states</b>

Flag \c state_changing_ctx_notice is set to \c !0 when a thread is about to
add the worker to a scheduling context or remove it from a scheduling context, and is
currently waiting for a safe window to do so, until the targeted worker is not in a
scheduling operation or parallel task operation anymore. This flag set to \c !0 will also
prevent the targeted worker to attempt a fresh scheduling operation or parallel
task operation to avoid starving conditions. However, a scheduling operation
that was already in progress before the notice is allowed to complete.

Flag \c state_changing_ctx_waiting is set to \c !0 when a scheduling context worker
addition or removal involving the targeted worker is about to occur and the
worker is currently performing a scheduling operation to tell the targeted
worker that the initiator thread is waiting for the scheduling operation to
complete and should be woken up upon completion.

<br>
<b>Relaxed synchronization related states</b>

Any StarPU worker may participate to scheduling operations, and in this process,
may be forced to observe state information from other workers. 
A StarPU worker thread may therefore be observed by any thread, even
other StarPU workers. Since workers may observe each other in any order, it is
not possible to rely exclusively on the \c sched_mutex of each worker to protect the
observation of worker state flags by other workers, because
worker A observing worker B would involve locking workers in (A B) sequence,
while worker B observing worker A would involve locking workers in (B A)
sequence, leading to lock inversion deadlocks.

In consequence, no thread must hold more than one worker's sched_mutex at any time.
Instead, workers implement a relaxed locking scheme based on the \c state_relax_refcnt
counter, itself protected by the worker's sched_mutex. When <code>state_relax_refcnt
> 0</code>, the targeted worker state flags may be observed, otherwise the thread attempting
the observation must repeatedly wait on the targeted worker's \c sched_cond
condition until <code>state_relax_refcnt > 0</code>.

The relaxed mode, while on, can actually be seen as a transactional consistency
model, where concurrent accesses are authorized and potential conflicts are
resolved after the fact. When the relaxed mode is off, the consistency model
becomes a mutual exclusion model, where the sched_mutex of the worker must be
held in order to access or change the worker state.

<br>
<b>Parallel tasks related states</b>

When a worker is scheduled to participate to the execution of a parallel task,
it must wait for the whole team of workers participating to the execution of
this task to be ready. While the worker waits for its teammates, it is not
available to run other tasks or perform other operations. Such a waiting
operation can therefore not start while conflicting operations such as
scheduling operations and scheduling context resizing involving the worker are
on-going. Conversely these operations and other may query weather the worker is
blocked on a parallel task entry with \ref starpu_worker_is_blocked_in_parallel().

The \ref starpu_worker_is_blocked_in_parallel() function is allowed to proceed while
and only while <code>state_relax_refcnt > 0</code>. Due to the relaxed worker locking scheme,
the \c state_blocked_in_parallel flag of the targeted worker may change after it
has been observed by an observer thread. In consequence, flag
\c state_blocked_in_parallel_observed of the targeted worker is set to \c 1 by the
observer immediately after the observation to "taint" the targeted worker. The
targeted worker will clear the \c state_blocked_in_parallel_observed flag tainting
and defer the processing of parallel task related requests until a full
scheduling operation shot completes without the
\c state_blocked_in_parallel_observed flag being tainted again. The purpose of this
tainting flag is to prevent parallel task operations to be started immediately
after the observation of a transient scheduling state.

Worker's management of parallel tasks is
governed by the following set of state flags and counters:

- \c state_blocked_in_parallel: set to \c !0 while the worker is currently blocked on a parallel
  task;

- \c state_blocked_in_parallel_observed: set to \c !0 to taint the worker when a
  thread has observed the state_blocked_in_parallel flag of this worker while
  its \c state_relax_refcnt state counter was \c >0. Any pending request to add or
  remove the worker from a parallel task team will be deferred until a whole
  scheduling operation shot completes without being tainted again.

- \c state_block_in_parallel_req: set to \c !0 when a thread is waiting on a request
  for the worker to be added to a parallel task team. Must be protected by the
  worker's \c sched_mutex.

- \c state_block_in_parallel_ack: set to \c !0 by the worker when acknowledging a
  request for being added to a parallel task team. Must be protected by the
  worker's \c sched_mutex.


- \c state_unblock_in_parallel_req: set to \c !0 when a thread is waiting on a request
  for the worker to be removed from a parallel task team. Must be protected by the
  worker's \c sched_mutex.


- \c state_unblock_in_parallel_ack: set to \c !0 by the worker when acknowledging a
  request for being removed from a parallel task team. Must be protected by the
  worker's \c sched_mutex.


- \c block_in_parallel_ref_count: counts the number of consecutive pending requests
  to enter parallel task teams. Only the first of a train of requests for
  entering parallel task teams triggers the transition of the
  \c state_block_in_parallel_req flag from \c 0 to \c 1. Only the last of a train of
  requests to leave a parallel task team triggers the transition of flag
  \c state_unblock_in_parallel_req from \c 0 to \c 1. Must be protected by the
  worker's \c sched_mutex.


\subsubsection CoreEntitiesWorkersOperations Operations

<b>Entry point</b>

All the operations of a worker are handled in an iterative fashion, either by
the application code on a thread launched by the application, or automatically
by StarPU on a device-dependent CPU thread launched by StarPU. Whether a
worker's operation cycle is managed automatically or
not is controlled per session by the field \c not_launched_drivers of the \c
starpu_conf struct, and is decided in \ref _starpu_launch_drivers() function.

When managed automatically, cycles of operations for a worker are handled by the corresponding
driver specific <code>_starpu_<DRV>_worker()</code> function, where \c DRV is a driver name such as
cpu (\c _starpu_cpu_worker) or cuda (\c _starpu_cuda_worker), for instance. 
Otherwise, the application must supply a thread which will repeatedly call \ref
starpu_driver_run_once() for the corresponding worker.

In both cases, control is then transferred to 
\ref _starpu_cpu_driver_run_once() (or the corresponding driver specific func).
The cycle of operations typically includes, at least, the following operations:

- <b>task scheduling</b>
- <b>parallel task team build-up</b>
- <b>task input processing</b>
- <b>data transfer processing</b>
- <b>task execution</b>

When the worker cycles are handled by StarPU automatically, the iterative
operation processing ends when the \c running field of \c _starpu_config
becomes false. This field should not be read directly, instead it should be read
through the \ref _starpu_machine_is_running() function.

<br>
<b>Task scheduling</b>

If the worker does not yet have a queued task, it calls
_starpu_get_worker_task() to try and obtain a task. This may involve scheduling
operations such as stealing a queued but not yet executed task from another
worker. The operation may not necessarily succeed if no tasks are ready and/or
suitable to run on the worker's computing unit.

<br>
<b>Parallel task team build-up</b>

If the worker has a task ready to run and the corresponding job has a size
\c >1, then the task is a parallel job and the worker must synchronize with the
other workers participating to the parallel execution of the job to assign a
unique rank for each worker. The synchronization is done through the job's \c
sync_mutex mutex.

<br>
<b>Task input processing</b>

Before the task can be executed, its input data must be made available on a
memory node reachable by the worker's computing unit. To do so, the worker calls
\ref _starpu_fetch_task_input()

<br>
<b>Data transfer processing</b>

The worker makes pending data transfers (involving memory node(s) that it is
driving) progress, with a call to \ref __starpu_datawizard_progress(),

<br>
<b>Task execution</b>

Once the worker has a pending task assigned and the input data for that task are
available in the memory node reachable by the worker's computing unit, the
worker calls \ref _starpu_cpu_driver_execute_task() (or the corresponding driver
specific function) to proceed to the execution of the task.


\subsection CoreEntitiesContexts Scheduling Contexts

A scheduling context is a logical set of workers governed by an instance of a
scheduling policy. Tasks submitted to a given scheduling context are confined to
the computing units governed by the workers belonging to this scheduling context
at the time they get scheduled.

A scheduling context is identified by an unsigned integer identifier between \c
0 and <code>STARPU_NMAX_SCHED_CTXS - 1</code>. The \c STARPU_NMAX_SCHED_CTXS
identifier value is reserved to indicated an unallocated, invalid or deleted
scheduling context.

Accesses to the scheduling context structure are governed by a
multiple-readers/single-writer lock (\c rwlock field). Changes to the structure
contents, additions or removals of workers, statistics updates, all must be done
with proper exclusive write access. 

\subsection CoreEntitiesWorkersAndContexts Workers and Scheduling Contexts

A worker can be assigned to one or more <b>scheduling contexts</b>. It
exclusively receives tasks submitted to the scheduling context(s) it is
currently assigned at the time such tasks are scheduled. A worker may add itself
to or remove itself from a scheduling context.

<br>
<b>Locking and synchronization rules between workers and scheduling contexts</b>

A thread currently holding a worker sched_mutex must not attempt to acquire a
scheduling context rwlock, neither for writing nor for reading. Such an attempt
constitutes a lock inversion and may result in a deadlock. 

A worker currently in a scheduling operation must enter the relaxed state before
attempting to acquire a scheduling context rwlock, either for reading or for
writing.

When the set of workers assigned to a scheduling context is about to be
modified, all the workers in the union between the workers belonging to the
scheduling context before the change and the workers expected to belong to the
scheduling context after the change must be notified using the \ref
notify_workers_about_changing_ctx_pending() function prior to the update. After
the update, all the workers in that same union must be notified for the update
completion with a call to \ref notify_workers_about_changing_ctx_done().

The function \ref notify_workers_about_changing_ctx_pending() places every
worker passed in argument in a state compatible with changing the scheduling
context assignment of that worker, possibly blocking until that worker leaves
incompatible states such as a pending scheduling operation. If the caller of
\c notify_workers_about_changing_ctx_pending() is itself a worker included in the set
of workers passed in argument, it does not notify itself, with the assumption
that the worker is already calling \c notify_workers_about_changing_ctx_pending()
from a state compatible with a scheduling context assignment update.
Once a worker has been notified about a scheduling context change pending, it
cannot proceed with incompatible operations such as a scheduling operation until
it receives a notification that the context update operation is complete.

\subsection CoreEntitiesDrivers Drivers

Each driver defines a set of routines depending on some specific hardware. These
routines include hardware discovery/initialization, task execution, device
memory management and data transfers.

While most hardware dependent routines are in source files located in the \c
/src/drivers subdirectory of the StarPU tree, some can be found elsewhere in the
tree such as \c src/datawizard/malloc.c for memory allocation routines or the
subdirectories of \c src/datawizard/interfaces/ for data transfer routines.

The driver ABI defined in the \ref _starpu_driver_ops structure includes the
following operations:

- \c .init: initialize a driver instance for the calling worker 
  managing a hardware computing unit compatible with
  this driver.

- \c .run_once: perform a single driver progress cycle for the calling worker
  (see \ref CoreEntitiesWorkersOperations).

- \c .deinit: deinitialize the driver instance for the calling worker

- \c .run: executes the following sequence automatically: call \c .init,
  repeatedly call \c .run_once until the function \ref
  _starpu_machine_is_running() returns false, call \c .deinit.

The source code common to all drivers is shared in
<code>src/drivers/driver_common/driver_common.[ch]</code>. This file includes
services such as grabbing a new task to execute on a worker, managing statistics
accounting on job startup and completion and updating the worker status

\subsubsection CoreEntitiesDriversMP Master/Slave Drivers

A subset of the drivers corresponds to drivers managing computing units in
master/slave mode, that is, drivers involving a local master instance managing
one or more remote slave instances on the targeted device(s). This includes
devices such as discrete manycore accelerators (e.g. Intel's Knight Corners
board, for instance), or pseudo devices such as a cluster of cpu nodes driver
through StarPU's MPI master/slave mode. A driver instance on the master side
is named the \b source, while a driver instances on the slave side is named
the \b sink.

A significant part of the work realized on the source and sink sides of
master/slave drivers is identical among all master/slave drivers, due to the
similarities in the software pattern. Therefore, many routines are shared among
all these drivers in the \c src/drivers/mp_common subdirectory. In particular, a
set of default commands to be used between sources and sinks is defined,
assuming the availability of some communication channel between them (see enum
\ref _starpu_mp_command)
