/*! \page StarPUJavaInterface StarPU Java Interface

The StarPU Java Interface provides the ability to execute Java applications on top of StarPU.

The interface allows to write either StarPU-like applications

\snippet java_starpu.java To be included. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

or Spark applications.

\snippet java_spark.java To be included. You should update doxygen if you see this text.

The installation process is not yet included in the StarPU autotools mechanism. However, a file \c INSTALL.org is provided in the \c starpujni directory to explain how to proceed with the installation, and shows how to run some basic examples.

\c hadoop needs to be installed before running the installation process.
