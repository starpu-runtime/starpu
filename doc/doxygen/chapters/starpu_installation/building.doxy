/*! \page BuildingAndInstallingStarPU Building and Installing StarPU

Depending on the level of customization required for the library
installation, we offer several solutions.

<ol>
  <li><b>Basic Installation or Evaluation:</b> If you are looking to
  simply try out the library, assess its performance on simple cases,
  run examples, or use the latest stable version, we recommend the
  following options:
    <ul>
    <li>
    For Linux Debian or Ubuntu distributions, consider using the latest
    StarPU Debian package (see \ref InstallingABinaryPackage).
    </li>
    <li>
    For macOS, you can opt for Brew and follow the steps in \ref
    InstallingASourcePackage.
    </li>
    <li>
    Using an already installed module on a cluster, as explained in
    \ref UsingModule
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Customization for Specific Needs:</b> If you intend to use
  StarPU but require modifications, such as switching to another version
  (git branch), changing the default MPI, utilizing a preferred
  compiler, or altering source code, consider these options:
    <ul>
    <li>
    Guix or Spack can be useful, as these package managers allow dynamic
    changes during source-based builds.
    Refer to \ref InstallingASourcePackage for details.
    </li>
    <li>
    Alternatively, you can directly build from the source using the native
    build system of the library (Makefile, GNU autotools). Instructions
    can be found in \ref InstallingFromSource.
    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Experiment Reproducibility:</b> If your focus is on experiment
  reproducibility, we recommend using Guix. Refer to \ref
  InstallingASourcePackage for guidance.
  </li>
</ol>

Whichever solution you choose, you can utilize the tool
<c>bin/starpu_config</c> to view all the configuration parameters used
during StarPU installation.

Please refer to the provided documentation for specific installation
steps and details for each solution.

\section InstallingABinaryPackage Installing a Binary Package

One of the StarPU developers being a Debian Developer, the packages
are well integrated and very up-to-date. To see which packages are
available, simply type:

\verbatim
$ apt-cache search starpu
\endverbatim

To install what you need, type for example:

\verbatim
$ sudo apt-get install libstarpu-dev
\endverbatim

\section InstallingASourcePackage Installing a Source Package

StarPU is available from different package managers.
<ul>
<li>
Guix https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-hpc
</li>
<li>
Spack https://github.com/spack/spack/
</li>
<li>
Brew https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/brew-repo
</li>
</ul>

Documentation on how to install StarPU with these package managers is
directly available from the links specified above. We give below a
brief overview of the spack installation.

\subsection SpackInstallation Installing the Spack Package

Here is a quick guide to install StarPU with spack.

\verbatim
$ git clone git@github.com:spack/spack.git
$ source ./spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh # if you use bash or zsh
$ spack install starpu
\endverbatim

By default, the latest release will be installed, one can choose to
install a specific release or even the master version.

\verbatim
$ spack install starpu@master
$ spack install starpu@1.3.5
\endverbatim

We strongly advise reading the detailed reference manual at
https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

\subsection UsingModule Using a Module

On some clusters, StarPU is provided as a module, for example on the
Jean Zay cluster. The information is available at
http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/cpu/jean-zay-cpu-starpu.html

\section InstallingFromSource Building from Source

StarPU can be built and installed by the standard means of the GNU
autotools. The following chapter is intended to briefly remind how these tools
can be used to install StarPU.

\subsection OptionalDependencies Optional Dependencies

The <c>hwloc</c> (http://www.open-mpi.org/software/hwloc) topology
discovery library is not mandatory to use StarPU, but strongly
recommended.  It allows for topology aware scheduling, which improves
performance. <c>hwloc</c> is available in major free operating system
distributions, and for most operating systems. Make sure to not only install
a <c>hwloc</c> or <c>libhwloc</c> package, but also <c>hwloc-devel</c> or
<c>libhwloc-dev</c> to have \c hwloc headers etc.

If <c>libhwloc</c> is installed in a standard
location, no option is required, it will be detected automatically,
otherwise \ref with-hwloc "--with-hwloc=<directory>" should be used to specify its
location.

If <c>libhwloc</c> is not available on your system, the option
\ref without-hwloc "--without-hwloc" should be explicitly given when calling the
script <c>configure</c>.


\subsection GettingSources Getting Sources

StarPU's sources can be obtained from the download page of
the StarPU website (https://starpu.gitlabpages.inria.fr/files/).

All releases and the development tree of StarPU are freely available
on StarPU SCM server under the LGPL license. Some releases are available
under the BSD license.

The latest release can be downloaded from the StarPU download page (https://starpu.gitlabpages.inria.fr/files/).

The latest nightly snapshot can be downloaded from the StarPU website (https://starpu.gitlabpages.inria.fr/files/testing/).

And finally, the current development version is also accessible via git.
It should only be used if you need the very latest changes (i.e. less
than a day old!).

\verbatim
$ git clone git@gitlab.inria.fr:starpu/starpu.git
\endverbatim

\subsection ConfiguringStarPU Configuring StarPU

Running <c>autogen.sh</c> is not necessary when using the tarball
releases of StarPU.  However, when using the source code from the git
repository, you first need to generate the script <c>configure</c> and the
different Makefiles. This requires the availability of <c>autoconf</c> and
<c>automake</c> >= 2.60.

\verbatim
$ ./autogen.sh
\endverbatim

You then need to configure StarPU. Details about options that are
useful to give to <c>configure</c> are given in \ref CompilationConfiguration.

\verbatim
$ ./configure
\endverbatim

If <c>configure</c> does not detect some software or produces errors, please
make sure to post the contents of the file <c>config.log</c> when
reporting the issue.

By default, the files produced during the compilation are placed in
the source directory. As the compilation generates a lot of files, it
is advised to put them all in a separate directory. It is then
easier to clean up, and this allows to compile several configurations
out of the same source tree. To do so, simply enter the directory
where you want the compilation to produce its files, and invoke the
script <c>configure</c> located in the StarPU source directory.

\verbatim
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
\endverbatim

By default, StarPU will be installed in <c>/usr/local/bin</c>,
<c>/usr/local/lib</c>, etc. You can specify an installation prefix
other than <c>/usr/local</c> using the option <c>--prefix</c>, for
instance:

\verbatim
$ ../configure --prefix=$HOME/starpu
\endverbatim

\subsection BuildingStarPU Building StarPU

\verbatim
$ make
\endverbatim

Once everything is built, you may want to test the result. An
extensive set of regression tests is provided with StarPU. Running the
tests is done by calling <c>make check</c> (by setting the variable \c STARPU_MICROBENCHS_DISABLED to disable benchmarks)

These tests are run every night and the result from the main profile
is publicly available
(https://starpu.gitlabpages.inria.fr/files/testing/master/).

\verbatim
$ STARPU_MICROBENCHS_DISABLED=1 make check
\endverbatim

\subsection InstallingStarPU Installing StarPU

In order to install StarPU at the location which was specified during
configuration:

\verbatim
$ make install
\endverbatim

If you have let StarPU install in <c>/usr/local/</c>, you additionally need to run

\verbatim
$ sudo ldconfig
\endverbatim

so the libraries can be found by the system.

Libtool interface versioning information are included in
libraries names (<c>libstarpu-1.4.so</c>, <c>libstarpumpi-1.4.so</c> and
<c>libstarpufft-1.4.so</c>).
