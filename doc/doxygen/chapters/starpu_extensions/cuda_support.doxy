/*! \page CUDASupport CUDA Support

StarPU sets the current CUDA device by calling starpu_cuda_set_device() which takes an integer argument representing the device number, and sets the current device to the specified device number. By setting the current device, applications can select which CUDA device to use for their computations, enabling efficient management of multiple CUDA devices in a system.

We can call starpu_cuda_get_nvmldev() to get identifier of the NVML device associated with a given CUDA device.

Three macros STARPU_CUDA_REPORT_ERROR(), STARPU_CUBLAS_REPORT_ERROR(), and STARPU_CUSPARSE_REPORT_ERROR() are useful for debugging and troubleshooting, as they provide detailed information about the error that occur during CUDA or CUBLAS execution.
