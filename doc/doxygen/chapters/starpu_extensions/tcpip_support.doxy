\section TCPIPMasterSlave TCP/IP Master Slave Support

StarPU provides a transparent way to execute applications across many
nodes. The Master Slave support permits to use remote cores without
thinking about data distribution. This support can be activated with
the \c configure option \ref enable-tcpip-master-slave
"--enable-tcpip-master-slave".

The existing kernels for CPU devices can be used as such. They only have to be
exposed through the name of the function in the \ref starpu_codelet::cpu_funcs_name field.
Functions have to be globally-visible (i.e. not static) for StarPU to
be able to look them up, and <c>-rdynamic</c> must be passed to gcc (or
<c>-export-dynamic</c> to ld) so that symbols of the main program are visible.

By default, one core is dedicated on the master node to manage the
entire set of slaves.

Choosing the number of cores on each slave device is done by setting
the environment variable \ref STARPU_NTCPIPMSTHREADS "STARPU_NTCPIPMSTHREADS=\<number\>"
with <c>\<number\></c> being the requested number of cores. By default,
all the slave's cores are used.

The master should be given the number of slaves that are expected to be run with
the \ref STARPU_TCPIP_MS_SLAVES environment variable.

The slaves should then be started, and their number also should be given with
the \ref STARPU_TCPIP_MS_SLAVES environment variable. They should additionally be
given the IP address of the master with the \ref STARPU_TCPIP_MS_MASTER environment
variable.

For simple local checks, one can use the <c>starpu_tcpipexec</c> tool, which just
starts the application several times. Setting the number of slaves nodes is done
by changing the <c>-np</c> parameter.
