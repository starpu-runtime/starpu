\fn int starpu_data_cpy(starpu_data_handle_t dst_handle, starpu_data_handle_t src_handle, int asynchronous, void (*callback_func)(void*), void *callback_arg)
\ingroup API_Miscellaneous_Helpers
Copy the content of \p src_handle into \p dst_handle. The parameter \p
asynchronous indicates whether the function should block or not. In
the case of an asynchronous call, it is possible to synchronize with
the termination of this operation either by the means of implicit
dependencies (if enabled) or by calling starpu_task_wait_for_all(). If
\p callback_func is not NULL, this callback function is executed after
the handle has been copied, and it is given the pointer \p callback_arg as argument.

\fn void starpu_execute_on_each_worker(void (*func)(void *), void *arg, uint32_t where)
\ingroup API_Miscellaneous_Helpers
This function executes the given function on a subset of workers. When
calling this method, the offloaded function \p func is executed by
every StarPU worker that may execute the function. The argument \p arg
is passed to the offloaded function. The argument \p where specifies
on which types of processing units the function should be executed.
Similarly to the field starpu_codelet::where, it is possible to
specify that the function should be executed on every CUDA device and
every CPU by passing ::STARPU_CPU|::STARPU_CUDA. This function blocks
until the function has been executed on every appropriate processing
units, so that it may not be called from a callback function for
instance.
