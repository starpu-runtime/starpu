To compile and execute this application outside StarPU :

$ clang -fopenmp ./hello-task.c
$ ldd ./a.out
...
	libomp.so.5 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libomp.so.5 (0x00007fbf3d42d000)
...
$ ./a.out
Hello from 0
Hey 0
Hey 1
Hey 2
Hey 3
Hey there
array: 1, 1, 1, 1,

To execute the application using the StarPU OpenMP LLVM support, one just needs it to create a symbolic link named libomp.so.5 to the StarPU OpenMP LLVM library, e.g

$ mkdir libs
$ ln -s $STARPU_ROOT/lib/libstarpu_openmp_llvm-1.4.so libs/libomp.so.5
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./a.out
