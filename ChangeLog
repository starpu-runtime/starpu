StarPU 1.1.0rc4 (svn revision 10951)

Changes:
  * Perfmodels: Modification of perfmodels output format for future improvements.

StarPU 1.1.0rc3 (svn revision xxx)
==============================================
The scheduling context release

Small features:
  * New function starpu_perfmodel_directory() to print directory
    storing performance models. Available through the new option -d of
    the tool starpu_perfmodel_display

StarPU 1.1.0rc2 (svn revision 10575)
==============================================
The scheduling context release

Changes:
  * StarPU-MPI: Fix potential bug for user-defined datatypes. As MPI
    can reorder messages, we need to make sure the sending of the size
    of the data has been completed.
  * Documentation is now generated through doxygen.

Small Changes:
  * Explicitly name the non-sleeping-non-running time "Overhead", and use
    another color in vite traces.
  * Use C99 variadic macro support, not GNU.
  * Fix performance regression: dmda queues were inadvertently made
    LIFOs in r9611.
  * Invert GPU-GPU direct transfer control environment variable name,
    i.e environment variable STARPU_ENABLE_CUDA_GPU_GPU_DIRECT should
    be used instead of STARPU_DISABLE_CUDA_GPU_GPU_DIRECT.

StarPU 1.1.0rc1 (svn revision 9750)
==============================================

New features:
  * OpenGL interoperability support.
  * Capability to store compiled OpenCL kernels on the file system
  * Capability to load compiled OpenCL kernels
  * Performance models measurements can now be provided explicitly by
    applications.
  * Capability to emit communication statistics when running MPI code
  * Add starpu_unregister_submit, starpu_data_acquire_on_node and
    starpu_data_invalidate_submit
  * New functionnality to wrapper starpu_insert_task to pass a array of
	data_handles via the parameter STARPU_DATA_ARRAY
  * Enable GPU-GPU direct transfers.
  * GCC plug-in
	- Add `registered' attribute
	- A new pass was added that warns about the use of possibly
	  unregistered memory buffers.
  * SOCL
        - Manual mapping of commands on specific devices is now
	  possible
        - SOCL does not require StarPU CPU tasks anymore. CPU workers
          are automatically disabled to enhance performance of OpenCL
          CPU devices
  * New interface: COO matrix.
  * Data interfaces: The pack operation of user-defined data interface
    defines a new parameter count which should be set to the size of
    the buffer created by the packing of the data.
  * MPI:
        - Communication statistics for MPI can only be enabled at
	  execution time by defining the environment variable
	  STARPU_COMM_STATS
        - Communication cache mechanism is enabled by default, and can
	  only be disabled at execution time by setting the
	  environment variable STARPU_MPI_CACHE to 0.
        - Initialisation functions starpu_mpi_initialize_extended()
  	  and starpu_mpi_initialize() have been made deprecated. One
	  should now use starpu_mpi_init(int *, char ***, int). The
	  last parameter indicates if MPI should be initialised.
        - Collective detached operations have new parameters, a
	  callback function and a argument. This is to be consistent
	  with the detached point-to-point communications.
        - When exchanging user-defined data interfaces, the size of
	  the data is the size returned by the pack operation, i.e
	  data with dynamic size can now be exchanged with StarPU-MPI.
  * Add experimental simgrid support, to simulate execution with various
    number of CPUs, GPUs, amount of memory, etc.
  * Add support for OpenCL simulators (which provide simulated execution time)
  * Add support for Temanejo, a task graph debugger
  * Theoretical bound lp output now includes data transfer time.
  * Update OpenCL driver to only enable CPU devices (the environment
        variable STARPU_OPENCL_ONLY_ON_CPUS must be set to a positive
	value when executing an application)
  * Add Scheduling contexts to separate computation resources
    	- Scheduling policies take into account the set of resources corresponding
	to the context it belongs to
	- Add support to dynamically change scheduling contexts
	(Create and Delete a context, Add Workers to a context, Remove workers from a context)
	- Add support to indicate to which contexts the tasks are submitted
  * Add the Hypervisor to manage the Scheduling Contexts automatically
    	- The Contexts can be registered to the Hypervisor
	- Only the registered contexts are managed by the Hypervisor
	- The Hypervisor can detect the initial distribution of resources of 
	a context and constructs it consequently (the cost of execution is required)
    	- Several policies can adapt dynamically the distribution of resources
	in contexts if the initial one was not appropriate
	- Add a platform to implement new policies of redistribution
	of resources
  * Implement a memory manager which checks the global amount of
    memory available on devices, and checks there is enough memory
    before doing an allocation on the device.
  * Discard environment variable STARPU_LIMIT_GPU_MEM and define
    instead STARPU_LIMIT_CUDA_MEM and STARPU_LIMIT_OPENCL_MEM
  * Introduce new variables STARPU_LIMIT_CUDA_devid_MEM and
    STARPU_LIMIT_OPENCL_devid_MEM to limit memory per specific device
  * Introduce new variable STARPU_LIMIT_CPU_MEM to limit memory for
    the CPU devices
  * New function starpu_malloc_flags to define a memory allocation with
    constraints based on the following values:
    - STARPU_MALLOC_PINNED specifies memory should be pinned
    - STARPU_MALLOC_COUNT specifies the memory allocation should be in
      the limits defined by the environment variables STARPU_LIMIT_xxx
      (see above). When no memory is left, starpu_malloc_flag tries
      to reclaim memory from StarPU and returns -ENOMEM on failure.
  * starpu_malloc calls starpu_malloc_flags with a value of flag set
    to STARPU_MALLOC_PINNED
  * Define new function starpu_free_flags similarly to starpu_malloc_flags
  * Define new public API starpu_pthread which is similar to the
    pthread API. It is provided with 2 implementations: a pthread one
    and a Simgrid one. Applications using StarPU and wishing to use
    the Simgrid StarPU features should use it.
  * Allow to have a dynamically allocated number of buffers per task,
    and so overwrite the value defined --enable-maxbuffers=XXX

Small features:
  * Add starpu_worker_get_by_type and starpu_worker_get_by_devid
  * Add starpu_fxt_stop_profiling/starpu_fxt_start_profiling which permits to
    pause trace recording.
  * Add trace_buffer_size configuration field to permit to specify the tracing
    buffer size.
  * Add starpu_codelet_profile and starpu_codelet_histo_profile, tools which draw
    the profile of a codelet.
  * File STARPU-REVISION --- containing the SVN revision number from which
    StarPU was compiled --- is installed in the share/doc/starpu directory
  * starpu_perfmodel_plot can now directly draw GFlops curves.
  * New configure option --enable-mpi-progression-hook to enable the
    activity polling method for StarPU-MPI.
  * Permit to disable sequential consistency for a given task.
  * New macro STARPU_RELEASE_VERSION
  * New function starpu_get_version() to return as 3 integers the
    release version of StarPU.
  * Enable by default data allocation cache

Changes:
  * Rename all filter functions to follow the pattern
    starpu_DATATYPE_filter_FILTERTYPE. The script
    tools/dev/rename_filter.sh is provided to update your existing
    applications to use new filters function names.
  * Renaming of diverse functions and datatypes. The script
    tools/dev/rename.sh is provided to update your existing
    applications to use the new names. It is also possible to compile
    with the pkg-config package starpu-1.0 to keep using the old
    names. It is however recommended to update your code and to use
    the package starpu-1.1.

  * Fix the block filter functions.
  * Fix StarPU-MPI on Darwin.
  * The FxT code can now be used on systems other than Linux.
  * Keep only one hashtable implementation common/uthash.h
  * The cache of starpu_mpi_insert_task is fixed and thus now enabled by
    default.
  * Improve starpu_machine_display output.
  * Standardize objects name in the performance model API
  * SOCL
    - Virtual SOCL device has been removed
    - Automatic scheduling still available with command queues not
      assigned to any device
    - Remove modified OpenCL headers. ICD is now the only supported
      way to use SOCL.
    - SOCL test suite is only run when environment variable
      SOCL_OCL_LIB_OPENCL is defined. It should contain the location
      of the libOpenCL.so file of the OCL ICD implementation.
  * Fix main memory leak on multiple unregister/re-register.
  * Improve hwloc detection by configure
  * Cell:
    - It is no longer possible to enable the cell support via the
      gordon driver
    - Data interfaces no longer define functions to copy to and from
      SPU devices
    - Codelet no longer define pointer for Gordon implementations
    - Gordon workers are no longer enabled
    - Gordon performance models are no longer enabled
  * Fix data transfer arrows in paje traces
  * The "heft" scheduler no longer exists. Users should now pick "dmda"
    instead.
  * StarPU can now use poti to generate paje traces.
  * Rename scheduling policy "parallel greedy" to "parallel eager"
  * starpu_scheduler.h is no longer automatically included by
    starpu.h, it has to be manually included when needed
  * New batch files to run StarPU applications with Microsoft Visual C
  * Add examples/release/Makefile to test StarPU examples against an
    installed version of StarPU. That can also be used to test
    examples using a previous API.
  * Tutorial is installed in ${docdir}/tutorial
  * Schedulers eager_central_policy, dm and dmda no longer erroneously respect
    priorities. dmdas has to be used to respect priorities.

Small changes:
  * STARPU_NCPU should now be used instead of STARPU_NCPUS. STARPU_NCPUS is
	still available for compatibility reasons.
  * include/starpu.h includes all include/starpu_*.h files, applications
	therefore only need to have #include <starpu.h>
  * Active task wait is now included in blocked time.
  * Fix GCC plugin linking issues starting with GCC 4.7.
  * Fix forcing calibration of never-calibrated archs.
  * CUDA applications are no longer compiled with the "-arch sm_13"
    option. It is specifically added to applications which need it.

Changes:
  * Several bug fixes in the build system
  * Bug fixes in source code for non-Linux systems
  * Fix generating FXT traces bigger than 64MiB.

==============================================

Changes:
  * Add starpu_block_shadow_filter_func_vector and an example.
  * Add tag dependency in trace-generated DAG.
  * Fix CPU binding for optimized CPU-GPU transfers.
  * Fix parallel tasks CPU binding and combined worker generation.
  * Fix generating FXT traces bigger than 64MiB.

StarPU 1.0.1 (svn revision 6659)
==============================================

  * hwloc support. Warn users when hwloc is not found on the system and
	produce error when not explicitely disabled.
  * Several bug fixes
  * GCC plug-in
	- Add `#pragma starpu release'
	- Fix bug when using `acquire' pragma with function parameters
	- Slightly improve test suite coverage
	- Relax the GCC version check
  * Update SOCL to use new API
  * Documentation improvement.

StarPU 1.0.0 (svn revision 6306)
==============================================
The extensions-again release

New features:
  * Add SOCL, an OpenCL interface on top of StarPU.
  * Add a gcc plugin to extend the C interface with pragmas which allows to
	easily define codelets and issue tasks.
  * Add reduction mode to starpu_mpi_insert_task.
  * A new multi-format interface permits to use different binary formats
	on CPUs & GPUs, the conversion functions being provided by the
	application and called by StarPU as needed (and as less as
	possible).
  * Deprecate cost_model, and introduce cost_function, which is provided
	with the whole task structure, the target arch and implementation
	number.
  * Permit the application to provide its own size base for performance
	models.
  * Applications can provide several implementations of a codelet for the
	same architecture.
  * Add a StarPU-Top feedback and steering interface.
  * Permit to specify MPI tags for more efficient starpu_mpi_insert_task

Changes:
  * Fix several memory leaks and race conditions
  * Make environment variables take precedence over the configuration
        passed to starpu_init()
  * Libtool interface versioning has been included in libraries names
        (libstarpu-1.0.so, libstarpumpi-1.0.so,
        libstarpufft-1.0.so, libsocl-1.0.so)
  * Install headers under $includedir/starpu/1.0.
  * Make where field for struct starpu_codelet optional. When unset, its
	value will be automatically set based on the availability of the
	different XXX_funcs fields of the codelet.
  * Define access modes for data handles into starpu_codelet and no longer
	in starpu_task. Hence mark (struct starpu_task).buffers as
	deprecated, and add (struct starpu_task).handles and (struct
	starpu_codelet).modes
  * Fields xxx_func of struct starpu_codelet are made deprecated. One
	should use fields xxx_funcs instead.
  * Some types were renamed for consistency. when using pkg-config libstarpu,
        starpu_deprecated_api.h is automatically included (after starpu.h) to
        keep compatibility with existing software. Other changes are mentioned
        below, compatibility is also preserved for them.
        To port code to use new names (this is not mandatory), the
        tools/dev/rename.sh script can be used, and pkg-config starpu-1.0 should
        be used.
  * The communication cost in the heft and dmda scheduling strategies now
        take into account the contention brought by the number of GPUs. This
        changes the meaning of the beta factor, whose default 1.0 value should
        now be good enough in most case.

Small features:
  * Allow users to disable asynchronous data transfers between CPUs and
	GPUs.
  * Update OpenCL driver to enable CPU devices (the environment variable
	STARPU_OPENCL_ON_CPUS must be set to a positive value when
	executing an application)
  * struct starpu_data_interface_ops --- operations on a data
        interface --- define a new function pointer allocate_new_data
        which creates a new data interface of the given type based on
        an existing handle
  * Add a field named magic to struct starpu_task which is set when
        initialising the task. starpu_task_submit will fail if the
        field does not have the right value. This will hence avoid
        submitting tasks which have not been properly initialised.
  * Add a hook function pre_exec_hook in struct starpu_sched_policy.
        The function is meant to be called in drivers. Schedulers
        can use it to be notified when a task is about being computed.
  * Add codelet execution time statistics plot.
  * Add bus speed in starpu_machine_display.
  * Add a STARPU_DATA_ACQUIRE_CB which permits to inline the code to be
	done.
  * Add gdb functions.
  * Add complex support to LU example.
  * Permit to use the same data several times in write mode in the
	parameters of the same task.

Small changes:
  * Increase default value for STARPU_MAXCPUS -- Maximum number of
        CPUs supported -- to 64.
  * Add man pages for some of the tools
  * Add C++ application example in examples/cpp/
  * Add an OpenMP fork-join example.
  * Documentation improvement.
