 * A window contain the tasks that failed to be pushed, so as when the prio_components reclaim
 * tasks by calling can_push to their parent (classically, just after a successful pop have
 * been made by its associated worker_component), this call goes up to the window_component which
 * pops a task from its local queue and try to schedule it by pushing it to the
 * decision_component.
 * Finally, the task will be pushed to the prio_component which is the direct
 * parent in the tree of the worker_component the task has been scheduled on. This
 * component will push the task on its local queue if no one of the two thresholds
 * have been reached for it, or send a push_error signal to its parent.
